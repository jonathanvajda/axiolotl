CCO 2.0 merged
- axiolotl
- all inference rules
-- 157 + 2892 = 3049 triples
-- 8 minutes 20 seconds

- rdflib infer-predicates.py
- all inference rules
-- 157 + 2542 = 2699 triples
-- 4 seconds


Proposed solution:
- materialize subClassOf+ outside of SPARQL, natively with N3.Store
- materialize subPropertyOf+ outside of SPARQL, natively with N3.Store
-- Note: this seems important to be done last? One needs to coax the domain, range, inverse, symmetric, etc. first, right?

Loading CCO merged takes 39 seconds? This is far too long. Need a loading wheel or load it faster

Querying over all triples in CCO merged (active workspace) takes about 9 seconds
